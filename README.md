# Required

## Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

🎯 Created using create-next-app

🎯 Design a SQL schema for a posts table, and a comments table that has a post_id column connecting it to the posts table.

🎯 Either create a form where users can add posts OR seed your database with at least 4 posts that comments can be added to (if you do the seed, one of the stretch goals will be harder).

🎯 Add a form to the individual post page to allow creating a new comment, which is saved to the new comments table including the Post ID.

🎯 Refresh the /posts route data when adding a new post, and redirect the user to the list of posts

🎯 Refresh the /post/:postId route when adding a new comment, so the new comment is displayed on the page

🎯 Add static and dynamic metadata to your pages

Had issues with applying background image to the site as I was gettign a bit confused between the root, html, main and body and what I should be targetting.

I didn't use components or split my code up as well as I hoped. Found it quite difficult to structure the project and would find I had added most of my code in one place but I think this might also be due to worrying about if I could finish the project in time.

- struggling with when i need to 'use client'
- and using 'use server'
- I think if I had of broken the project up better with components this wouldn't have been so much of an issue

- managed to get the api to work, at the start was a bit confused on how to use the key but once this was fixed it was a good api to work with
- biggest hurdle was figuring out how to single out the name of the villager from my db so that this could be used in the api call to get the villager data I wanted

- found my css a bit of a nightmare this week as I didn't name things clearly
- was also having an issue where className didn't seem to be affecting the property I wanted it to which caused more hassle later on, I should've fixed it at the time
- tailwind was helpful to apply styling to some elements where I wanted to change things easily/quickly but I find its harder to read than it all being layed out in the css file where I can compare elements
